Water Pollution in India 
Context:
There has been increased interest among the public about the Environment and living conditions in India. Especially, after since many manufacturing units are being planned, people are worried about how it will affect the underground water quality and the environment. Government of India, under the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has released the Water Quality Affected Data for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The objective here is to analyze this data alongside with Forest, Industries, Habitation, and development projects data in the same area (panchayat) to figure out whether there is any connection between the development effort and the quality of water getting affected. This effort will identify such associations and create awareness such that people and the Govt. can act in time to avoid further deterioration of the water resources. Java

Focus should be on the area (Panchayat/Village) rather than the district or the state as a whole, and observations should be made if there are any associations between the other sets of data available for the same area (from industrial, habitation, manufacturing and other sources, which I intend to add here also
